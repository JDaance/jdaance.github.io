title: Skyturns top ten game on Chilean website!
categories: media general
---

Hey hey ! I was really happy to find this article on a Chilean website listing their top 10 Android games, and it includes Skyturns :)

What makes me extra happy is that the other games in the list are really good. My favorite games Monument Valley and True Skate are included, for example. I really like Skyturns taking a place with those giants..

Of course the website does not seem to be very big or anything, and sales have not changed in any way (Well the game is everywhere to pirate for Android so :)
