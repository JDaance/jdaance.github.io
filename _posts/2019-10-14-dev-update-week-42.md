title: Dev Update - Week 42
category: devlog
---

This week we are looking forward to releasing the level editor and complementary game update to facilitate level sharing. When it’s done players will be able to create and share levels effortlessly.

Joakim is also looking into adding a thumbnail to the link of replay/level sharing so that you get a quick overview of the content of the link.

Our goal is to move the level editor in-game as soon as the web based level editor is released.

So far we found some bugs with the web based level editor that we are looking in to.

The iPhone version of the game is also coming along nicely with our developer making rapid progress. We need this out before the end of October or Apple will remove the app from their store! Let’s hope the deadline is kept.
