Hey, just closed the Discourse forum and opened a subreddit instead: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Skyturns](https://www.reddit.com/r/Skyturns)

This will be the central place to share levels, we can even upvote levels and look at the best levels this month or year. Its a good start to create a thriving community. And people already know Reddit and maybe even has an account so thats good.

Level sharing is coming next week, so now we are ready :)
