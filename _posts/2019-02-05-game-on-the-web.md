Ok so just published Skyturns as a web game! Its compiled from C++ to js using emscripten. I have used this technology for the (as of yet secret) level editor for a long while. Its just a very early version, lots of polish missing.

The goal is to have the complete game and its ecosystem with saved times and replays, best times, editor, forum, etc here on the website. And the smartphone versions are just another client to this place. Its very easy to spread a website game -- no install necessary. But on phones we will need to disable to javascript game and point people to the apps. But for desktops/laptops this will be great, the game is actually a lot of fun with the keyboard.

Major things right now:

- Frame rate is kind of weird
- No touch controls on mobile
- No sound or music

Improvements coming, stay tuned :)
