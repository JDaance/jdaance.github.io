Ok so just published Skyturns as a web game! Its compiled from C++ to js using emscripten. I have used this technology for the (as of yet secret) level editor for a long while. But! Its very buggy. Its not playable at all. So.. dont hate me!

The goal is to have the complete game and its ecosystem with best times, editor, forum, etc here on the website. And the smartphone versions are just another client to this place. Its very easy to spread a website game -- no install necessary. But on phones we will need to disable to javascript game and point people to the apps. But for desktops/laptops this will be great, the game is actually a lot of fun with the keyboard.

Major bugs right now:

- Cant control the character
- Weird graphical glitches
- Just hangs when entering menu / dying / pausing
- No sound or music
- I thiiink it might not work in chrome, only firefox right now

Improvements coming, stay tuned :)
