title: Game removed from App stores
category: general
---

Google Play removed the game around new years because of some metadata stuff, kind of without warning. Which pissed me off! And iOS was marking the game as "slowing down your device" and asking another $100 for the next year. So I kind of decided to just fuck it, time for a break from this shit. Uploading a new version to the app stores and complying with all the rules is one to several days of work, work which is just totally messy and random and fuck-u-ish. I've done it enough times. So right now the only ways to get the game are:

Android:
 - Google for an APK and make sure to get version 1.0.4 (this way is really good, Android freedom is nice)

iOS
 - Earn my trust to get all the sources and logins and help me publish it again. (preferably with the $100 on your end :)
