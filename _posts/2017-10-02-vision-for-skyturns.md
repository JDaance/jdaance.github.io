title: The Vision for Skyturns
category: general
---

I want to give something to the world, something of myself. Lets not go too deep into the philosophical thing about the meaning of life, lets just say I feel a **ick urgency to stop hiding and sharing my love and understanding of the world. This game is a part of that. Its a ***ing excellent game. It has depth and longevity and variation like few other games. Its a masterpiece really. There are many good games out there, many masterpieces, and I would stand no chance to make a game like this, had it not been for their good example. I know when it feels right, when the game is good enough, when it is great. And three years after release, I can still conclude that Skyturns is a great game. Its not for everyone though, but with 6 billion people on this earth, and soon as many smart phones, I feel that the game has a definite role to play and it would be a shame if it stops where it is right now.
