So Skyturns was released last november, about a year ago. At that time I was pretty much burned out working on the game for two years. The release went well with a lot of downloads for the first month. Then Google gave up on the game or something and downloads dropped to one tenth, which sucked a bit.

On the other hand the game has been pirated to a very large extent and seen a massive amount of players through that. I had a common bug in the first version, 1.0.1, which caused a lua crash about every 10 "noob plays", like running straight into a the first obstacle on the first level. Anyway I have crash reporting through HockeyApp, and this particular crash has been recorded about 2-300 000 times. I have no other stats to go by then that, but thats a hell of a lot of plays to cause that many bug reports. I still see about 500-3000 bug reports for that thing in 1.0.1 every day. I fixed the bug and released an update in about a week, releasing 1.0.1, but it seems pirate sites didnt really catch up with that and still had 1.0.1 everywhere. The piracy spread of later versions is pretty much unknown to me.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
