Just a minor update that the web version is now playable! Progress is saved locally in the browser, and should never be lost unless some cache is cleared. There is still a lot of work to do but its a first working version.

Major things remaining:

- Frame rate is kind of weird
- No touch controls on mobile
- Full screen on mobile
- No sound or music

Improvements coming, stay tuned :)
