	<h1>Skyturns beta install</h1>

	Remember this is a beta TEST. So you are a tester of the game and are supposed to report your experiences positive and negative :) If something strange happens while playing (running) you can pause the game and press "Dump replay". This will upload your run to our server and give us a chance to see exactly what happened and fix any problems.<br><br>

	Have fun! // J&R

	<h2>Android</h2>
	Just download and install from this link: <a href="http://skyturns.se/skyturns.apk">skyturns.apk</a>

	<h2>iOS</h2>
    Follow these steps:
  <ul>
		<li>First you have to supply us your device UDID for us to add to the app to make Apple happy. One way to get UDID is by visiting <a href="http://get.udid.io/">http://get.udid.io/</a> from your device, or following this guide through iTunes: <a href="http://whatsmyudid.com/">http://whatsmyudid.com/</a>. </li>
		<li>Send your UDID to Joakim or Rebecka and we will add it to the app.</li>
		<li>Wait a few hours until you download the app from this site. (After we get the UDID we have to update the code and upload a new version of the app to the site)</li>
	</ul>
	<p><br>

	After we have manually added your UDID you can install the game from your device by following this link: <a href="itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/20sdbtrvqo2nke4/Skyturns.plist">Skyturns iOS install</a> <br>
    
	<span style="font-size: 0.8em">(Latest update of the code: 2014-04-23 kl 18:15) </span>	</p>
    
    
	<h3>Troubles?</h3>
    <ul>
    	<li>If iOS refuses to install make sure we have added your UDID to the app</li>
		<li>On Android you might need to enable some setting to allow apps from outside Google Play</li>
		<li>If Android install just fails, it's usually out of space. Worst case you might have to uninstall an older version of Skyturns first.</li>
	</ul>
